The project aims to use gillespie algorithm to show different gene expression patterns arising from various enhancer-promoter regulatory mechanisms.
The matlab file is the code to apply gillespie algorithm for the E-P interaction model and the python script is useful in calculating gene expression level from the cluster size and also calculates noise arising from multiple enhancers.
